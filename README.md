# MORSE
MORSE is a code that infers equation of state (EoS) parameters from a joint posterior distribution on neutron star masses and radii. 
Effectively there are two parts to the code:
 - The first part calculates a mass-radius curve given an EoS by solving the relativistic stellar structure equations (TOV-     equations)
 - The second part transforms a joint posterior distribution on neutron star masses and radii to a posterior distribution on EoS parameters in a Bayesian framework.
